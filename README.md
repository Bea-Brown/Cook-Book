# Cook-Book
A desktop-based cookbook application built with Windows Forms, C#, and SQL. Designed for chefs and cooks to manage recipes offline â€” including adding, editing, deleting, and searching recipes. This is an early-stage prototype and still undergoing refinement for usability, performance, and design.
